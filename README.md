The Cart object has methods for adding and removing items from the cart.
The script also includes error handling code to handle scenarios such as the port already being in use.

4-	Implementation

The script will be implemented in Node.js, and will be integrated with the existing e-commerce application.
The script will be tested thoroughly to ensure that it is functioning as intended, and any necessary adjustments will be made.


5-	Technologies
NodeJS, Express, Express-Session, Nodemon, hbs - Express.js view engine for handlebars.js .
